General Information
===================

This is the first version of setop. setop is a small console program for parsing input files and streams for string elements and applying several set operations and special queries.

setop is written from scratch in C++ with extensive use of the std and the boost library. It is developed under and mainly for Linux, but has no OS specific limitations.



Installation
============

setop requires boost >= 1.54, actually libboost-program-options-dev and libboost-regex-dev, and a nearly full C++11 support from the compiler.

Simple install procedure:
% make
  [ Become root if necessary ]
% make install

Otherwise, if you only want to compile, just type:
% make setop

Or otherwise, if you want to compile “manually”, try something like:
% g++ src/main.cpp -o setop -lboost_program_options -lboost_regex -std=c++11 -O3


Usage
=====

For information on how to use setop, just type
% setop -h
or
% man setop
after installing.


Packaging for Debian
====================

In February 2016 I tried to package setop for the Debian repository, but it wasn’t accepted, see <https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2016/02/msg00042.html>.

You can use the files in the directory debian for creating a deb file by applying the following steps:

# at first, download the sources from Github <https://github.com/phisigma/setop>

# after that, unpack them and move them into a directory with name setop-0.1
% unzip setop-master.zip
% mv setop-master setop-0.1

# gzip sources in Debian convention
% tar -zcvf setop_0.1.orig.tar.gz setop-0.1 --exclude setop-0.1/debian

# build package
% cd setop-0.1
% dpkg-buildpackage -sa -us -uc
# or otherwise, if you even want to sign it
% dpkg-buildpackage -sa
% cd ..

# now you can install, distribute, and/or test the package (become root if necessary)
% dpkg -i setop_0.1-1_amd64.deb

# or if you want, you can upload it to Debian
% dput mentors setop_0.1-1_amd64.changes
