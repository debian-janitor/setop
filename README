General Information
===================

This is the first version of setop. setop is a small console program for parsing input files and streams for string elements and applying several set operations and special queries.

setop is written from scratch in C++ with extensive use of the std and the boost library. It is developed under and mainly for Linux, but has no OS specific limitations.



Installation
============

setop requires boost >= 1.54, actually libboost-program-options-dev and libboost-regex-dev, and a nearly full C++11 support from the compiler.

Simple install procedure:
% make
  [ Become root if necessary ]

Otherwise, if you only want to compile, just type:
% make setop

Or otherwise, if you want to compile “manually”, try something like:
% g++ src/main.cpp -o setop -lboost_program_options -lboost_regex -std=c++11 -O3

For information on how to use setop, just type

or
% man setop
after installing.
